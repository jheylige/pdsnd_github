### Project Title
Posting Bikeshare Project on Github

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import bike share data and to answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that took in raw input that created an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics

### Files used
bikeshare.py, chicago.csv, wasington.csv, new_york_city.csv

### Credits
Udacity's Programming in Data Science curriculum provided some of the initial code, supporting documentation and lessons. I also conducted research of bike sharing businesses on this site (https://www.commuteoptions.org/the-many-benefits-of-bike-sharing-programs/) and using Google.
